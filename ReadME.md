# FatRec32 💾
Recovery tool written in C for FAT32 disk file recovery with cryptographic validation ✨

## 🔍 Overview

FatRec32 is a high-performance recovery tool designed to retrieve deleted files from FAT32 file systems. 

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 High Recovery Rate**: Recovers up to 95% of deleted FAT32 data
- **🔐 Cryptographic Validation**: Uses OpenSSL to verify data
- **⚡ Performance Optimized**: Memory-mapping techniques for faster recovery
- **🛠️ Versatile Recovery Options**:
  - Recover specific files with name matching
  - Bulk recovery of all deleted files
  - Special handling for non-contiguous files
  - SHA1 validation for recovered files

## 📥 Installation

### Prerequisites

- GCC or compatible C compiler
- OpenSSL development libraries
- Make

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fatrec32.git
cd fatrec32

# Build using make
make
```

## 🚀 Usage

```
Usage: fatrec32 disk <options>
  -i                     Print the file system information.
  -l                     List the root directory.
  -r filename [-s sha1]  Recover a contiguous file.
  -R filename -s sha1    Recover a possibly non-contiguous file.
  -ra filename           Recover all files with the given name.
  -all                   Recover all deleted files.
```

### 📝 Examples

```bash
# Print information about the file system
./fatrec32 fat32.disk -i

# List files in the root directory
./fatrec32 fat32.disk -l

# Recover a specific deleted file
./fatrec32 fat32.disk -r document.pdf

# Recover a file and verify its integrity with SHA1
./fatrec32 fat32.disk -r document.pdf -s 5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8

# Recover all deleted files
./fatrec32 fat32.disk -all

# Recover all instances of a specific filename
./fatrec32 fat32.disk -ra backup.zip
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

FatRec32 works by scanning the FAT32 filesystem at the byte level, identifying deleted file entries and reconstructing file contents based on cluster chain analysis. 

- **📊 Memory-Mapped I/O**: Directly maps disk sectors to memory for faster access
- **🔗 Cluster Chain Recovery**: Advanced algorithms to reconstruct fragmented files
- **🔍 File Carving Techniques**: Signature-based recovery for specific file types
- **🔐 Cryptographic Validation**: SHA1 hashing to verify file post-recovery
